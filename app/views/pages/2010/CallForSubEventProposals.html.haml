    RubyKaigi 2010 Call for Sub-Event Proposals
  %p
    RubyKaigi is seeking sub-event proposals for RubyKaigi 2010. If you have an idea that doesn't fit the usual "presentation" format and would like to run it as part of RubyKaigi 2010 in Tsukuba, Japan this year, we'd love to hear from you.
  %p.spec{ :style => "margin-top:20px" }
    So, what is a sub-event?
  %p
    Here are a few events that have been held at RubyKaigi and other Ruby conferences in the past that we consider to be good examples of a "sub-event".

      JRubyConf: A conference focused on JRuby, held after RubyConf 2009 at the same venue.
    %li
      RubyConf5k: A 5km running(!) race held during RubyConf 2009
    %li
      Regional RubyKaigi Kaigi: An open meeting ("kaigi") held at RubyKaigi 2009 where Regional conference organizers got together to discuss the organization of regional events

      Ruby Implementors meeting, a gathering for Ruby committers and implementors held during RubyKaigi 2008
